This repository is for the wireframe assignment of my 2nd full-stack capstone for Thinkful's Engineering Flex program.
It contains:
  Screen inventory (distinct pages in your app):
  1. Home page that describes app, provides instructions, has nav bar
  2. Form that allows user to report an instance of COVID-19
  3. Page that allows user to select what data they want to see.
  4. Page that displays the data the user selected (ex. a graph showing reported instances of COVID-19 by state)

  Coded and deployed wireframes:
  1. https://lmcmaaser.github.io/COVID-19Watch-wireframe/
  2. https://lmcmaaser.github.io/COVID-19Watch-wireframe/report-form
  3. https://lmcmaaser.github.io/COVID-19Watch-wireframe/select-form
  4. https://lmcmaaser.github.io/COVID-19Watch-wireframe/graph

  User flows for each wireframe
